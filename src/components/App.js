            I enjoy all aspects of Software Development, I have a strong foundation in back/front 
            end development. I've worked on projects in an Agile environment and always brought a positive attitude 
            to the team. I also enjoy learning new technologies and solving problems. My Full Stack skills is what sets me apart as I'll be able to solve problems on the front end and back end.
